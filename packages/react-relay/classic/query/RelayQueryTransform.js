/**
 * @internal
 *
 * `RelayQueryTransform` is a `RelayQueryVisitor` subclass that simplifies the
 * process of traversing, filtering, or transforming a Relay Query.
 *
 * The traversal is a map operation from `RelayQuery` nodes to nodes. The
 * default implementation traverses all nodes and maps each one to its
 * original value (ie. a no-op).
 *
 * Just like `RelayQueryVisitor`, subclasses of `RelayQueryTransform` can
 * optionally implement methods to customize the traversal and mapping of
 * different RelayQuery node types:
 *
 * - `visitField(field, state)`: Returns the new value for the visited field, or
 *   `null` to remove it from the output.
 * - `visitFragment(fragment, state)`: Returns the new value for the visited
 *   fragment, or `null` to remove it from the output.
 * - `visitQuery(fragment, state)`: Returns the new value for the top-level
 *   query, or `null` to transform the entire query out of existence.
 *
 * There are two additional methods for controlling the traversal:
 *
 * - `traverse(parent, state)`: Returns a cloned copy of the parent node after
 *   processing all of its children. Does not clone if nothing changed.
 * - `visit(child, state)`: Processes the child node, calling the appropriate
 *   `visit{Field,Fragment,Root` method based on the node type.
 *
 * All of these methods may return the original node in order to leave it
 * intact.
