(Relay only)

The hooks APIs that Relay exposes allow you to read data from the store only
during the render phase. In order to read data from outside of the render
phase (or from outside of React), Relay exposes the `@inline` directive. The
data from a fragment annotated with `@inline` can be read using `readInlineData`.

For use with [`useRefetchableFragment`](https://relay.dev/docs/api-reference/use-refetchable-fragment/).

The @refetchable directive can only be added to fragments that are
"refetchable", that is, on fragments that are declared on Viewer or Query
types, or on a type that implements `Node` (i.e. a type that has an id).

(Relay Only)

A directive that modifies queries and which causes Relay to generate
`$Parameters.js` files and preloadable concrete requests. Required if the
query is going to be used as part of an entry point.

The `hackPreloader` argument is FB only and generates a Hack preloader file.

`@required` is a directive you can add to fields in your Relay queries to
declare how null values should be handled at runtime. You can think of it as
saying "if this field is ever null, its parent field is invalid and should be
