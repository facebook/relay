# Updated version of the Relay Docs

In order to build and run these docs locally, execute the following commands:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:facebook/relay.git
# or git clone https://github.com/facebook/relay.git
cd relay/website-v2/
yarn
yarn start
```

Now, `localhost:3000` should open automatically, where you can see the docs.
