# Open source

We discussed various ways to increase our transparency improve the communication with our open source users:

- Will start publishing meeting notes here on the wiki.
- We have a couple of talks which were given in venues but not recorded; intend to give these again and video them for wider distribution.
- Will update our roadmap [#788](https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/788).
- Will set up a repo analogous to [react-future](https://github.com/reactjs/react-future).

Plenty of other ideas, but discussion was time-boxed; will continue later this week.

# H1 roadmap

We have a [Roadmap document](https://github.com/facebook/relay/wiki/Roadmap) but it is out of date. Rather than dump the contents of our discussion here in the notes I will just update the document [#788](https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/788).
