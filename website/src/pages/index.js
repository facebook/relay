          <h2>Built for scale</h2>
          <p>
            Relay is designed for high performance at any scale. Relay keeps
            management of data-fetching easy, whether your app has tens,
            hundreds, or thousands of components. And thanks to Relayâ€™s
            incremental compiler, it keeps your iteration speed fast even as
            your app grows.

                    <p>
                      Relay is data-fetching turned <b>declarative</b>.
                      Components declare their data dependencies, without
                      worrying about how to fetch them. Relay guarantees that
                      the data each component needs is fetched and available.
                      This keeps components decoupled and promotes reuse.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      With Relay, components and their data dependencies can be
                      quickly modified without modifying other parts of the
                      system. That means you won't accidentally break other
                      components as you refactor or make changes to your app.

                      Relay's compiler aggregates and optimizes the data
                      requirements for your entire app, so that they can be
                      efficiently fetched in a single GraphQL request.

                    <p>
                      Relay handles the heavy lifting to ensure the data
                      declared by your components is fetched in the most
                      efficient way. For example, by deduplicating identical
                      fields, and precomputing information used at runtime,
                      among other optimizations.

                      Relay automatically keeps all of your components up to
                      date when data that affects them changes, and efficiently
                      updates them only when strictly necessary. This means no
                      unnecessary re-renders.

                    <p>
                      Relay also supports executing GraphQL Mutations,
                      optionally with optimistic updates, and updates to local
                      data, while ensuring that visible data on the screen is
                      always kept up to date.

              <h2>Fetching query data</h2>
              <p>
                The simplest way to fetch query data is to directly call{' '}
                <LoadQueryLink />.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later, you can read the data from the store in a functional
                React component by calling the <UsePreloadedQueryLink /> hook.
              </p>
              <p>
                Relay encourages you to call <LoadQueryLink /> in response to an
                event, such as when a user presses on a link to navigate to a
                particular page or presses a button. See the guided tour section
                on <QueriesLink /> for more.

              <h2>Fragments</h2>
              <p>
                Step two is to render a tree of React components powered by
                Relay. Components use fragments to declare their data
                dependencies, and read data from the Relay store by calling{' '}
                <UseFragmentLink />.
              </p>
              <p>
                A fragment is a snippet of GraphQL that is tied to a GraphQL
                type (like <code>Artist</code>) and which specifies <i>what</i>{' '}
                data to read from an item of that type.
              </p>
              <p>
                <UseFragmentLink /> takes two parameters: a fragment literal and
                a fragment reference. A fragment reference specifies{' '}
                <i>which</i> entity to read that data from.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fragments cannot be fetched by themselves; instead, they must
                ultimately be included in a parent query. The Relay compiler
                will then ensure that the data dependencies declared in such
                fragments are fetched as part of that parent query.

                      local Relay data in response to a mutation.

                      Relay generates Flow or TypeScript types for each of your
                      React components that use Relay, which represent the data
                      that each component receives, so you can make changes more
                      quickly and safely while knowing that correctness is

                      If you already can render React components, you're most of
                      the way there. Relay requires a Babel plugin, and to also
                      run the Relay Compiler.

                      Relay requires a bit more up-front setup and tools, in
                      favour of supporting an architecture of isolated
                      components which can scale with your team and app
                      complexity.

                      Relay is critical infrastructure in Facebook, there are

                      in tandem with GraphQL and has full-time staff working to
                      improve it.
