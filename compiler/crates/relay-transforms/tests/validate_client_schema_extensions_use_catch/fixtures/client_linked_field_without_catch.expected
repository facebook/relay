==================================== ERROR ====================================
✖︎ Expected client-defined field within `@throwOnFieldError` to be annotated with `@catch`. Accessing an unset field is treated as a field error, but Relay cannot guarantee that client field will be set before they are read. Add `@catch` to explicitly handle the case where the field is unset.
