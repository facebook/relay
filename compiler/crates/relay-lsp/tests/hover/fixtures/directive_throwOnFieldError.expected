==================================== OUTPUT ===================================
(Relay only)

A directive added to queries and fragments which causes the Relay client to throw
if reading a field that has an error. Relay will also honor the @semanticNonNull
directive on fields read from that query or fragment. Emitted types for such
fields will be non-null. Requires the `experimental_emit_semantic_nullability_types`
typegen configuration to be enabled.
