/**
 * @internal
 *
 * Base class for traversing a Relay Query.
 *
 * Subclasses can optionally implement methods to customize the traversal:
 *
 * - `visitField(field, state)`: Called for each field.
 * - `visitFragment(fragment, state)`: Called for each fragment.
 * - `visitQuery(fragment, state)`: Called for the top level query.
 *
 * A `state` variable is passed along to all callbacks and can be used to
 * accumulate data while traversing (effectively passing data back up the tree),
 * or modify the behavior of later callbacks (effectively passing data down the
 * tree).
 *
 * There are two additional methods for controlling the traversal:
 *
 * - `traverse(parent, state)`: Visits all children of `parent`. Subclasses
 *   may override in order to short-circuit traversal. Note that
 *   `visit{Field,Fragment,Query}` are //not// called on `parent`, as it will
 *   already have been visited by the time this method is called.
 * - `visit(child, state)`: Processes the `child` node, calling the appropriate
 *   `visit{Field,Fragment,Query}` method based on the node type.
 *
 * By convention, each of the callback methods returns the visited node. This is
 * used by the `RelayQueryTransform` subclass to implement mapping and filtering
 * behavior, but purely-visitor subclases do not need to follow this convention.
