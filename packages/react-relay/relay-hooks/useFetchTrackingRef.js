/**
 * This hook returns a mutable React ref that holds the value of whether a
 * fetch request is in flight. The reason this is a mutable ref instead of
 * state is because we don't actually want to trigger an update when this
 * changes, but instead synchronously keep track of whether the network request
 * is in flight, for example in order to bail out of a request if one is
 * already in flight. If this was state, due to the nature of concurrent
 * updates, this value wouldn't be in sync with when the request is actually
 * in flight.
 * The additional functions returned by this Hook can be used to mutate
 * the ref.
