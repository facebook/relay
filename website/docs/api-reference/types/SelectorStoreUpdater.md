#### Type `SelectorStoreUpdater`

* A function with signature `(store: RecordSourceSelectorProxy, data) => void`
* This interface allows you to *imperatively* write and read data directly to and from the Relay store. This means that you have full control over how to update the store in response to the subscription payload: you can *create entirely new records*, or *update or delete existing ones*. The full API for reading and writing to the Relay store is available <a href={useBaseUrl('docs/api-reference/store/#recordsourceselectorproxy')}>here</a>.
