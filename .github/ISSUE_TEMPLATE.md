# Creating issues for Relay

## Questions regarding how to use Relay and/or GraphQL

We want to keep signal strong in the GitHub issue tracker â€“ to make sure that it remains the best place to track issues that affect the development of Relay.

If you have a question on how to use Relay, please [post it to Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=relayjs) with the tag [#relayjs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/relayjs).

## Reporting issues with Relay

We will be using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new issue, make sure an issue for your problem doesn't already exist.

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. To make reproduction simple for you, and set-up simple for Relay's maintainers, you can use Glitch:
https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/relay-starter-kit

You can also provide a public repository with a runnable example.

## Security bugs

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe disclosure of security bugs. With that in mind, please do not file public issues; go through the process outlined on that page.
