It provides a way for developers to specify the precise data needed for a view and enables a client to fetch that data in a single network request. Compared to traditional approaches such as REST, GraphQL helps applications to fetch data more efficiently (compared to resource-oriented REST approaches) and avoid duplication of server logic (which can occur with custom endpoints). Furthermore, GraphQL helps developers to decouple product code and server logic. For example, a product can fetch more or less information without requiring a change to every relevant server endpoint. It\'s a great way to fetch data.","sidebar":"version-v7.0.0/docs"},"thinking-in-relay":{"id":"thinking-in-relay","title":"Thinking In Relay","description":"Relay\'s approach to data-fetching is heavily inspired by our experience with React. In particular, React breaks complex interfaces into reusable components, allowing developers to reason about discrete units of an application in isolation, and reducing the coupling between disparate parts of an application. Even more important is that these components are declarative: they allow developers to specify what the UI should look like for a given state, and not have to worry about how to show that UI. Unlike previous approaches that used imperative commands to manipulate native views (e.g. the DOM), React uses a UI description to automatically determine the necessary commands.","sidebar":"version-v7.0.0/docs"},"type-emission":{"id":"type-emission","title":"Type Emission","description":"As part of its normal work, relay-compiler will emit type information for your language of choice that helps you write type-safe application code.
