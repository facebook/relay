# React Native / Relay TodoMVC

## Installation

```
npm install -g react-native-cli && npm install
```

## Running

### Start the GraphQL server:

```
npm start
```

### Ensure you can connect to the development server:

#### iOS

Ensure that you are on the same WiFi network as your computer. If you're using a
cell data plan, your phone can't access your computer's local IP address.

#### Android

You need to run `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` to forward requests from the
device to your computer. This works only on Android 5.0 and newer.

#### If all else fails

Open `app.js` and change `localhost:8080` to an IP/port that your device can
access.

### Run on your device of choice:

```
react-native run-ios  # or...
react-native run-android
```

## Developing

If at any time you make changes to `data/schema.js`, stop the server,
regenerate `data/schema.json`, and restart the server:

```
npm run update-schema
npm start
```
