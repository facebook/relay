/**
 * Hook used to fetch a GraphQL query during render. This hook can trigger multiple nested or waterfalling round trips if used without caution, and waits until render to start a data fetch (when it can usually start a lot sooner than render), thereby degrading performance. Instead, prefer [`usePreloadedQuery`](../use-preloaded-query).
 *
 * @example
 * const React = require('React');
 *
 * const {graphql, useLazyLoadQuery} = require('react-relay');
 *
 * function App() {
 *   const data = useLazyLoadQuery(
 *     graphql`
 *       query AppQuery($id: ID!) {
 *         user(id: $id) {
 *           name
 *         }
 *       }
 *     `,
 *     {id: 4},
 *     {fetchPolicy: 'store-or-network'},
 *   );
 *
 *  return <h1>{data.user?.name}</h1>;
 * }
 *
 * @returns - `data`: Object that contains data which has been read out from the Relay store; the object matches the shape of specified query.
 *   - The Flow type for data will also match this shape, and contain types derived from the GraphQL Schema. For example, the type of `data` above is: `{| user: ?{| name: ?string |} |}`.
