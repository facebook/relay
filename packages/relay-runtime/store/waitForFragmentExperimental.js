/**
 * EXPERIMENTAL: This API is experimental and does not yet support all Relay
 * features. Notably, it does not correectly handle plural fragments or some
 * features of Relay Resolvers.
 *
 * Given a fragment and a fragment reference, returns a promise that resolves
 * once the fragment data is available, or rejects if the fragment has an error.
 * Errors include both network errors and field errors due to @required(action:
 * THROW) or @throwOnFieldError.

 * This API is intended for use when consuming data outside of a UI framework, or
 * when you need to imperatively access data inside an event handler. For example,
 * you might choose to @defer a fragment that you only need to access inside an
 * event handler and then await its value inside the handler if/when it is triggered.
