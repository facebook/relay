# Agenda

* Project updates

**Note:** There was no update last week because the team was in a "war room" converting a React Native product within the main Facebook Android and iOS apps to use Relay 2.

# Project Updates

## Relay 1:2 interop

**Goal:** Here is to make it possible for most components to be written with Relay 2 syntax/APIs and have them work either in Relay 1 or Relay 2. Implementation detail: use of a so-called "compatibility container".

**Status:** Filled in multiple gaps during the war room, enough to fully convert two full top-level views within the app (now have support for fragment variables, provided imports, mutations).

**End of week goal:** Basically done; will address any gaps that arise as we continue to convert products.

## Relay 2 product integration

**Goal:** Here is to convert a couple of significant views in a production app which will exercise major facets of the framework such as pagination and mutations.

**Status:** As noted above, we were able to port two full top-level views within the app. This includes the ability to run them via either Relay 1 or Relay 2 thanks to the compatibility container. We will have metrics in place to allow us to compare the performance in production of the two implementations. We have a candidate for another large React Native product inside the main Facebook app to port next; they should be ready for us within a couple of weeks.

## Mutations

**Goal:** Is to finish the API for basic server and optimistic mutations (initially not connections, then connections).

**Status:** Basics are done, and the building blocks for connection mutations are in place; will build higher-level API on top of this as needed in the future.

## Pagination

**Goal:** Is to support easy pagination in Relay 2.

**Status:** `@connection` directive is in place and working; the refetch container is up and running and makes writing views with simple pagination straightforward (eg. `this.props.relay.refetch({after: 'cursor', first: 10})`).

**End of week goal:** Replace manual pagination in existing product code with simpler version that uses the refetch container.

## Refetching

**Goal:** Is to have easy refetching in Relay 2, analogous to current `setVariables` API.

**Status:** Prototype is working and expected to land soon; some follow-up diffs landing for short-circuiting via boolean diffing.

## Packager

**Goal:** Have fast (scalable) and convenient builds for codebase using Relay 2.

**Status:** We now have a Watchman-driven `codegen` script that monitors the entire repo and regenerates all queries within about 1s whenever there is a change.

## Pokes Dashboard

**Goal:** Ship Relay 2 powered Pokes Dashboard to 100% of production users.

**Status:** Nothing blocking us from turning this on for the public; aim to do so before the end of the week.

## Native disk cache

**Goal:** Collect metrics and publish internal report.

**Status:** Wrote up learnings in report; no further action planned for now so wrapping this project up.

## Open source

**Status:** Fairly quiet on this front: of some interest, there has been activity on [a PR](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/662) to get Relay into `create-react-app`.

**Current owner(s):** [@yuzhi](https://github.com/yuzhi) (on call)

## Relay 1

**Status:** Nothing to report.
