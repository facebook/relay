When referring to **"refreshing a fragment"**, we mean fetching the *exact* same data that was originally rendered by the fragment, in order to get the most up-to-date version of that data from the server.

## Using real-time features

<OssOnly>
If we want to keep our data up to date with the latest version from the server, the first thing to consider is if it appropriate to use any real-time features, which can make it easier to automatically keep the data up to date without manually refreshing the data periodically.

One example of this is using [GraphQL Subscriptions](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/updating-data/graphql-subscriptions/), which will require additional configuration on your server and [network layer](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/updating-data/graphql-subscriptions/#configuring-the-network-layer).

## Using `useRefetchableFragment`

In order to manually refresh the data for a fragment, we need a query to refetch the fragment under; remember, *fragments can't be fetched by themselves: they need to be part of a query,* so we can't just "fetch" the fragment again by itself.

To do so, we can also use the [`useRefetchableFragment`](../../../api-reference/use-refetchable-fragment/) Hook in combination with the `@refetchable` directive, which will automatically generate a query to refetch the fragment under, and which we can fetch using the `refetch` function:

<FbInternalOnly>
  <FbRefreshingFragments />
</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>

```js
import type {UserComponent_user$key} from 'UserComponent_user.graphql';
// This type is autogenerated by Relay given @refetchable used below
import type {UserComponentRefreshQuery} from 'UserComponentRefreshQuery.graphql';

type Props = {
  user: UserComponent_user$key,
};

function UserComponent(props: Props) {
  const [data, refetch] = useRefetchableFragment<UserComponentRefreshQuery, _>(
    graphql`
      fragment UserComponent_user on User
      # @refetchable makes it so Relay autogenerates a query for
      # fetching this fragment
      @refetchable(queryName: "UserComponentRefreshQuery") {
        id
        name
        friends {
          count
        }
      }
    `,
    props.user,
  );

  const refresh = useCallback(() => {
    // We call refetch with empty variables: `{}`,
    // which will refetch the @refetchable query with the same
    // original variables the fragment was fetched with, and update
    // this component with the latest fetched data.
    // The fetchPolicy ensures we always fetch from the server and skip
    // the local data cache.
    refetch({}, {fetchPolicy: 'network-only'})
  }), [/* ... */];

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <div>Friends count: {data.friends?.count}</div>
      <Button
        onClick={() => refresh()}>
        Fetch latest count
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Let's distill what's happening in this example:

* `useRefetchableFragment` behaves similarly to [`useFragment`](../../../api-reference/use-fragment/) (see the [Fragments](../../rendering/fragments/) section), but with a few additions:
    * It expects a fragment that is annotated with the `@refetchable` directive. Note that  `@refetchable` directive can only be added to fragments that are "refetchable", that is, on fragments that are on `Viewer`, on `Query`, on any type that implements `Node` (i.e. a type that has an `id` field).
* It returns a `refetch` function, which is already Flow typed to expect the query variables that the generated query expects
* It takes two Flow type parameters: the type of the generated query (in our case  `UserComponentRefreshQuery`), and a second type which can always be inferred, so you only need to pass underscore (`_`).
* We're calling the `refetch` function with 2 main inputs:
    * The first argument is the set of variables to fetch the fragment with. In this case, calling `refetch` and passing an empty set of variables will fetch the fragment again *with the exact same variables the fragment was originally fetched with,* which is what we want for a refresh.
    * In the second argument we are passing a `fetchPolicy` of `'network-only'` to ensure that we always fetch from the network and skip the local data cache.
* Calling `refetch` will re-render the component and cause `useRefetchableFragment` to suspend (as explained in [Loading States with Suspense](../../rendering/loading-states/)), since a network request will be required due to the `fetchPolicy` we are using. This means that you'll need to make sure that there's a `Suspense` boundary wrapping this component from above in order to show a fallback loading state.

:::info
Note that this same behavior also applies to using the `refetch` function from [`usePaginationFragment`](../../../api-reference/use-pagination-fragment).

### If you need to avoid Suspense

In some cases, you might want to avoid showing a Suspense fallback, which would hide the already rendered content. For these cases, you can use [`fetchQuery`](../../../api-reference/fetch-query/) instead, and manually keep track of a loading state:

<FbInternalOnly>
  <FbAvoidSuspenseCaution />
</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>
  <OssAvoidSuspenseNote />
</OssOnly>

```js
import type {UserComponent_user$key} from 'UserComponent_user.graphql';
// This type is autogenerated by Relay given @refetchable used below
import type {UserComponentRefreshQuery} from 'UserComponentRefreshQuery.graphql';

type Props = {
  user: UserComponent_user$key,
};

function UserComponent(props: Props) {
  const [data, refetch] = useRefetchableFragment<UserComponentRefreshQuery, _>(
    graphql`
      fragment UserComponent_user on User
      # @refetchable makes it so Relay autogenerates a query for
      # fetching this fragment
      @refetchable(queryName: "UserComponentRefreshQuery") {
        id
        name
        friends {
          count
        }
      }
    `,
    props.user,
  );

  const [isRefreshing, setIsRefreshing] = useState(false);
  const refresh = useCallback(() => {
    if (isRefreshing) { return; }
    setIsRefreshing(true);

    // fetchQuery will fetch the query and write
    // the data to the Relay store. This will ensure
    // that when we re-render, the data is already
    // cached and we don't suspend
    fetchQuery(environment, AppQuery, variables)
      .subscribe({
        complete: () => {
          setIsRefreshing(false);

          // *After* the query has been fetched, we call
          // refetch again to re-render with the updated data.
          // At this point the data for the query should
          // be cached, so we use the 'store-only'
          // fetchPolicy to avoid suspending.
          refetch({}, {fetchPolicy: 'store-only'});
        }
        error: () => {
          setIsRefreshing(false);
        }
      });
  }), [/* ... */];

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <div>Friends count: {data.friends?.count}</div>
      <Button
        disabled={isRefreshing}
        onClick={() => refresh()}>
        Fetch latest count {isRefreshing ? <LoadingSpinner /> : null}
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Let's distill what's going on here:

* When refreshing, we now keep track of our own `isRefreshing` loading state, since we are avoiding suspending. We can use this state to render a busy spinner or similar loading UI in our component, *without* hiding the content.
* In the event handler, we first call `fetchQuery`, which will fetch the query and write the data to the local Relay store. When the `fetchQuery` network request completes, we call `refetch` so that we render the updated data, similar to the previous example.
* At this point, when `refetch` is called, the data for the fragment should already be cached in the local Relay store, so we use `fetchPolicy` of `'store-only'` to avoid suspending and only read the already cached data.
