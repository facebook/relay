When referring to **"refreshing a query"**, we mean fetching the *exact* same data that was originally rendered by the query, in order to get the most up-to-date version of that data from the server.

## Using real-time features

If we want to keep our data up to date with the latest version from the server, the first thing to consider is if it appropriate to use any real-time features, which can make it easier to automatically keep the data up to date without manually refreshing the data periodically.

One example of this is using [GraphQL Subscriptions](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/updating-data/graphql-subscriptions), which will require additional configuration on your server and [network layer](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/updating-data/graphql-subscriptions/#configuring-the-network-layer).

## When using `useQueryLoader` / `loadQuery`

To refresh a query using the [`useQueryLoader`](../../../api-reference/use-query-loader/) Hook described in our [Fetching Queries for Render](../../rendering/queries/#fetching-queries-for-render) section, we only need to call `loadQuery` again:

<FbInternalOnly>
  <FbRefreshingQueriesUsingUseQueryLoader />
</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>

```js
/**
 * App.react.js
 */

const AppQuery = require('__generated__/AppQuery.graphql');

function App(props: Props) {
  const [queryRef, loadQuery] = useQueryLoader(
    AppQuery,
    props.appQueryRef /* initial query ref */
  );

  const refresh = useCallback(() => {
    // Load the query again using the same original variables.
    // Calling loadQuery will update the value of queryRef.
    // The fetchPolicy ensures we always fetch from the server and skip
    // the local data cache.
    const {variables} = props.appQueryRef;
    loadQuery(variables, {fetchPolicy: 'network-only'});
  }, [/* ... */]);

  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback="Loading query...">
      <MainContent
        refresh={refresh}
        queryRef={queryRef}
      />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
}
```

```js
/**
 * MainContent.react.js
 */

// Renders the preloaded query, given the query reference
function MainContent(props) {
  const {refresh, queryRef} = props;
  const data = usePreloadedQuery(
    graphql`
      query AppQuery($id: ID!) {
        user(id: $id) {
          name
          friends {
            count
          }
        }
      }
    `,
    queryRef,
  );

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{data.user?.name}</h1>
      <div>Friends count: {data.user.friends?.count}</div>
      <Button
        onClick={() => refresh()}>
        Fetch latest count
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Let's distill what's going on here:

* We call `loadQuery` in the event handler for refreshing, so the network request starts immediately, and then pass the updated `queryRef` to the `MainContent` component that uses `usePreloadedQuery`, so it renders the updated data.
* We are passing a `fetchPolicy` of `'network-only'` to ensure that we always fetch from the network and skip the local data cache.
* Calling `loadQuery` will re-render the component and cause `usePreloadedQuery` to suspend (as explained in [Loading States with Suspense](../../rendering/loading-states/)), since a network request will always be made due to the `fetchPolicy` we are using. This means that we'll need to make sure that there's a `Suspense` boundary wrapping the `MainContent` component in order to show a fallback loading state.

### If you need to avoid Suspense

In some cases, you might want to avoid showing a Suspense fallback, which would hide the already rendered content. For these cases, you can use [`fetchQuery`](../../../api-reference/fetch-query/) instead, and manually keep track of a loading state:

<FbInternalOnly>
  <FbAvoidSuspenseCaution />
</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>
  <OssAvoidSuspenseNote />
</OssOnly>

```js
/**
 * App.react.js
 */

const AppQuery = require('__generated__/AppQuery.graphql');

function App(props: Props) {
  const environment = useRelayEnvironment();
  const [queryRef, loadQuery] = useQueryLoader(
    AppQuery,
    props.appQueryRef /* initial query ref */
  );
  const [isRefreshing, setIsRefreshing] = useState(false)

  const refresh = useCallback(() => {
    if (isRefreshing) { return; }
    const {variables} = props.appQueryRef;
    setIsRefreshing(true);

    // fetchQuery will fetch the query and write
    // the data to the Relay store. This will ensure
    // that when we re-render, the data is already
    // cached and we don't suspend
    fetchQuery(environment, AppQuery, variables)
      .subscribe({
        complete: () => {
          setIsRefreshing(false);

          // *After* the query has been fetched, we call
          // loadQuery again to re-render with a new
          // queryRef.
          // At this point the data for the query should
          // be cached, so we use the 'store-only'
          // fetchPolicy to avoid suspending.
          loadQuery(variables, {fetchPolicy: 'store-only'});
        }
        error: () => {
          setIsRefreshing(false);
        }
      });
  }, [/* ... */]);

  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback="Loading query...">
      <MainContent
        isRefreshing={isRefreshing}
        refresh={refresh}
        queryRef={queryRef}
      />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
}
```

Let's distill what's going on here:

* When refreshing, we now keep track of our own `isRefreshing` loading state, since we are avoiding suspending. We can use this state to render a busy spinner or similar loading UI inside the `MainContent` component, *without* hiding the `MainContent`.
* In the event handler, we first call `fetchQuery`, which will fetch the query and write the data to the local Relay store. When the `fetchQuery` network request completes, we call `loadQuery` so that we obtain an updated  `queryRef` that we then pass to `usePreloadedQuery` in order render the updated data, similar to the previous example.
* At this point, when `loadQuery` is called, the data for the query should already be cached in the local Relay store, so we use `fetchPolicy` of `'store-only'` to avoid suspending and only read the already cached data.


## When using `useLazyLoadQuery`

To refresh a query using the [`useLazyLoadQuery`](../../../api-reference/use-lazy-load-query/) Hook described in our [Lazily Fetching Queries during Render](../../rendering/queries/#lazily-fetching-queries-during-render) section, we can do the following:

<FbInternalOnly>
  <FbRefreshingQueriesUsingUseLazyLoadQuery />
</FbInternalOnly>

<OssOnly>

```js
/**
 * App.react.js
 */
const AppQuery = require('__generated__/AppQuery.graphql');

function App(props: Props) {
  const variables = {id: '4'};
  const [refreshedQueryOptions, setRefreshedQueryOptions] = useState(null);

  const refresh = useCallback(() => {
    // Trigger a re-render of useLazyLoadQuery with the same variables,
    // but an updated fetchKey and fetchPolicy.
    // The new fetchKey will ensure that the query is fully
    // re-evaluated and refetched.
    // The fetchPolicy ensures that we always fetch from the network
    // and skip the local data cache.
    setRefreshedQueryOptions(prev => ({
      fetchKey: (prev?.fetchKey ?? 0) + 1,
      fetchPolicy: 'network-only',
    }));
  }, [/* ... */]);

  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback="Loading query...">
      <MainContent
        refresh={refresh}
        queryOptions={refreshedQueryOptions ?? {}}
        variables={variables}
      />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
```

```js
/**
 * MainContent.react.js
 */

// Fetches and renders the query, given the fetch options
function MainContent(props) {
  const {refresh, queryOptions, variables} = props;
  const data = useLazyLoadQuery(
    graphql`
      query AppQuery($id: ID!) {
        user(id: $id) {
          name
          friends {
            count
          }
        }
      }
    `,
    variables,
    queryOptions,
  );

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{data.user?.name}</h1>
      <div>Friends count: {data.user.friends?.count}</div>
      <Button
        onClick={() => refresh()}>
        Fetch latest count
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

Let's distill what's going on here:

* We update the component in the event handler for refreshing by setting new options in state. This will cause the `MainContent` component that uses `useLazyLoadQuery` to re-render with the new `fetchKey` and `fetchPolicy`, and refetch the query upon rendering.
* We are passing a new value of `fetchKey` which we increment on every update. Passing a new `fetchKey` to `useLazyLoadQuery` on every update will ensure that the query is fully re-evaluated and refetched.
* We are passing a `fetchPolicy` of `'network-only'` to ensure that we always fetch from the network and skip the local data cache.
* The state update in `refresh` will cause the component to suspend (as explained in [Loading States with Suspense](../../rendering/loading-states/)), since a network request will always be made due to the `fetchPolicy` we are using. This means that we'll need to make sure that there's a `Suspense` boundary wrapping the `MainContent` component in order to show a fallback loading state.

            fetchPolicy: 'store-only',
          }));
        }
        error: () => {
          setIsRefreshing(false);
        }
      });
  }, [/* ... */]);

  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback="Loading query...">
      <MainContent
        isRefreshing={isRefreshing}
        refresh={refresh}
        queryOptions={refreshedQueryOptions ?? {}}
        variables={variables}
      />
    </React.Suspense>
