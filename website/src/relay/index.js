                Declare the data your components need with GraphQL, Relay
                determines how and when to fetch your data.

                GraphQL is written next to the views that rely on them. Relay
                aggregates queries into efficient network requests.

            <p>
              Relay Modern is a new version of Relay designed from the ground up
              to be easier to use, more extensible and, most of all, able to
              improve performance on mobile devices. Relay Modern accomplishes
              this with static queries and ahead-of-time code generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Incrementally convert existing Relay apps, or start a new one with
              Relay Modern.
