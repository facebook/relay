But the implementation is often much more complex. Imperative approaches require us to implement all of those steps: reach into the UI and toggle the button, initiate a network request, retry it if necessary, show an error if it fails (and untoggle the button), etc. The same goes for data-fetching: specifying ',Object(i.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"what")," data we need often dictates ",Object(i.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"how")," and ",Object(i.b)("em",{parentName:"p"},"when")," it is fetched. Next, we'll explore our approach to solving these concerns with ",Object(i.b)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Relay"),"."),Object(i.b)(o.a,{mdxType:"DocsRating"}))}u.isMDXComponent=!0},323:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.d(t,"a",(function(){return u})),n.d(t,"b",(function(){return b}));var a=n(0),r=n.n(a);function i(e,t,n){return t in e?Object.defineProperty(e,t,{value:n,enumerable:!0,configurable:!0,writable:!0}):e[t]=n,e}function o(e,t){var n=Object.keys(e);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var a=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);t&&(a=a.filter((function(t){return Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(e,t).enumerable}))),n.push.apply(n,a)}return n}function c(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var n=null!=arguments[t]?arguments[t]:{};t%2?o(Object(n),!0).forEach((function(t){i(e,t,n[t])})):Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors?Object.defineProperties(e,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(n)):o(Object(n)).forEach((function(t){Object.defineProperty(e,t,Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(n,t))}))}return e}function s(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,a,r=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,a,r={},i=Object.keys(e);for(a=0;a<i.length;a++)n=i[a],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(r[n]=e[n]);return r}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var i=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(a=0;a<i.length;a++)n=i[a],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(r[n]=e[n])}return r}var l=r.a.createContext({}),h=function(e){var t=r.a.useContext(l),n=t;return e&&(n="function"==typeof e?e(t):c(c({},t),e)),n},u=function(e){var t=h(e.components);return r.a.createElement(l.Provider,{value:t},e.children)},p={inlineCode:"code",wrapper:function(e){var t=e.children;return r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,{},t)}},d=r.a.forwardRef((function(e,t){var n=e.components,a=e.mdxType,i=e.originalType,o=e.parentName,l=s(e,["components","mdxType","originalType","parentName"]),u=h(n),d=a,b=u["".concat(o,".").concat(d)]||u[d]||p[d]||i;return n?r.a.createElement(b,c(c({ref:t},l),{},{components:n})):r.a.createElement(b,c({ref:t},l))}));function b(e,t){var n=arguments,a=t&&t.mdxType;if("string"==typeof e||a){var i=n.length,o=new Array(i);o[0]=d;var c={};for(var s in t)hasOwnProperty.call(t,s)&&(c[s]=t[s]);c.originalType=e,c.mdxType="string"==typeof e?e:a,o[1]=c;for(var l=2;l<i;l++)o[l]=n[l];return r.a.createElement.apply(null,o)}return r.a.createElement.apply(null,n)}d.displayName="MDXCreateElement"},324:function(e,t,n){"use strict";(function(e){var a=this&&this.__createBinding||(Object.create?function(e,t,n,a){void 0===a&&(a=n),Object.defineProperty(e,a,{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return t[n]}})}:function(e,t,n,a){void 0===a&&(a=n),e[a]=t[n]}),r=this&&this.__setModuleDefault||(Object.create?function(e,t){Object.defineProperty(e,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:t})}:function(e,t){e.default=t}),i=this&&this.__importStar||function(e){if(e&&e.__esModule)return e;var t={};if(null!=e)for(var n in e)"default"!==n&&Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,n)&&a(t,e,n);return r(t,e),t};Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),t.OssOnly=t.FbInternalOnly=t.isInternal=t.validateFbContentArgs=t.fbInternalOnly=t.fbContent=t.bloks=void 0,t.bloks=i(n(327));const o=["internal","external"];let c;try{c=n(325).usePluginData}catch(p){c=null}function s(e){return h(e),u()?"internal"in e?l(e.internal):[]:"external"in e?l(e.external):[]}function l(e){return"function"==typeof e?e():e}function h(e){if("object"!=typeof e)throw new Error(`fbContent() args must be an object containing keys: ${o}.
