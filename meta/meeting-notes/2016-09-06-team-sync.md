# Project Updates

## Relay 1:2 interop

**Goal:** here is to make it possible for most components to be written with Relay 2 syntax/APIs and have them work either in Relay 1 or Relay 2. Implementation detail: use of a so-called "compatibility container".

**Status:** Compatibility compiler is in; still working on provided variables (needed for device pixel ratio and other similar use cases).

**End of week goal:** Convert all leaf nodes views without `setVariables` in selected product to Relay 2.

## Relay 2 product integration

**Goal:** here is to convert a couple of significant views in a production app which will exercise major facets of the framework such as pagination and mutations.

**Status:** Performance logging is now in, so we have a baseline to compare against when we port to Relay 2.

**Current owner(s):** [@yuzhi](https://github.com/yuzhi) (out this week)

## Mutations

**Goal:** is to finish the API for basic server and optimistic mutations (initially not connections, then connections).

**Status:** Basic version is done, including ability to rollback and rebase optimistic mutations with new server data. `viewer` hack is also in. Should address connection mutations soon, but need to do more work on that side before we do.

## Pagination

**Goal:** is to support easy pagination in Relay 2.

**Status:** No change from last week.

**End of week goal:** Prototype of simple load-more pagination.

## Refetching

**Goal:** is to have easy refetching in Relay 2, analogous to current `setVariables` API.

**Status:** Have rough sketch of refetch container API as described last week, still need to test in app and write automated tests.

## Packager

**Goal:** have fast (scalable) and convenient builds for codebase using Relay 2.

**Status:** Chatted with Packager engineers. Will meet periodically in the future to check on progress. Current plan is to run a separate process for Relay 2.

## Pokes Dashboard

**Goal:** ship Relay 2 powered Pokes Dashboard to 100% of production users.

**Status:** Relay 2 version of Pokes Dashboard is now turned on for a high percentage of employees. Jan is looking at data to make sure it's solid. Will proceed to public roll-out after that.

## Native disk cache

**Goal:** collect metrics and publish internal report.

**Status:** Had to fix broken test but still working on getting data.

**End of week goal:** Have all the data ready for the report.

## Open source

**Status:** Merged 16 PRs and closed 44 issues. Cut 0.9.3 releases of react-relay and graphql-relay NPM packages. For next release, should update our graphql package dependency to 0.7.0 (or whatever is current then).

## Relay 1

**Status:** Plenty of internal usage; approximately 25 posts in the internal Relay Support group for the week.
