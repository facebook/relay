/**
 * Utility function for testing Relay Resolvers. Pass the resolver function and
 * the data that will be returned from `readFragment` and it will return the
 * value that the resolver would derive.
 *
 * *Note:* Relay fragment data includes a special `$fragmentType` key which is
 * impossible for non-Relay code to construct. In tests you can work around
 * this by passing `null` with a Flow suppression:
 *
 * ```
 * const fragmentData = {
 *   // Other fields here...
 *   $fragmentType: (null: any)
 * };
 *
 * const actual = testResolver(resolverFunc, fragmentData);
 * expect(actual).toEqual(expectedValue)
 * ```
