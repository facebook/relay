Relay is a framework for managing and declaratively fetching GraphQL data. Specifically, it provides a set of APIs to fetch and declare data dependencies for React components, in colocation with component definitions themselves.

In this guide, we're going to go over how to use Relay to build out some of the more common use cases in apps. If you're interested in a detailed reference of our APIs, check out our [Relay API Reference](../api-reference/use-fragment/) page.
