The Relay team is happy to announce the release of Relay v15 as well as v2 of the Relay VSCode extension. While these releases are major version bumps and includes a couple of breaking changes, we expect that most users will be unaffected and will experience a seamless upgrade. You can find the full list of changes in the [v15 Release Notes](https://github.com/facebook/relay/releases/tag/v15.0.0).

## What's new in Relay 15?

### Support for `@refetchable` on interfaces

Previously it wasn't possible to add the `@refetchable` directive on fragment definitions on server interface types.

```
// schema.graphql

interface RefetchableInterfaceFoo @fetchable(field_name: "id") {
    id: ID!
}

extend type Query {
  fetch__RefetchableInterfaceFoo(id: ID!): RefetchableInterfaceFoo
}

// fragment

fragment RefetchableFragmentFoo on RefetchableInterfaceFoo
  @refetchable(queryName: "RefetchableFragmentFooQuery") {
  id
}
```

### Persisted query improvements

If you use URL-based persisted queries, you can now specify custom headers to send with the request that persists the query. For example, this can be used to send auth headers to your query persistence URL endpoint.

```js
persistConfig: {
  url: 'example.com/persist',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'bearer TOKEN'
  }
}
```

For file-based persisted queries, we added a new feature flag, `compact_query_text`, that removes all whitespace from the persisted query text. This can make the file more than 60% smaller. This new feature flag can be enabled within your Relay config file.

```js
persistConfig: {
  file: 'path/to/file.json',
  algorithm: 'SHA256'
},
featureFlags: {
  compact_query_text: true
}
```

### Typesafe updates now support missing field handlers

Typesafe updaters now support missing field handlers. Previously, if you selected `node(id: 4) { ... on User { name, __typename } }` in a typesafe updater, but that user was fetched in a different way (e.g. with `best_friend { name }`), you would not be able to access and mutate that user using the typesafe updater.

In this release, we add support for missing field handlers in typesafe updaters, meaning that if a missing field handler is set up for node (as in [this example](https://relay.dev/docs/next/guided-tour/reusing-cached-data/filling-in-missing-data/#internaldocs-banner)), you will be able to update the user's name with this missing field handler.

In order to support this, the signature of [missing field handlers](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/reusing-cached-data/filling-in-missing-data) has been changed. The `record` argument to the handler used to recieve a `Record` type (which is an untyped grab-bag of data). It now receives a `ReadOnlyRecordProxy`. Furthermore, the field argument of type `NormalizationLinkedField` is now `CommonLinkedField`, which is a type containing the properties found in both `ReaderLinkedField` and `NormalizationLinkedField`.

### Flow type improvements

Flow users will now get types inferred from `graphql` literals with more Relay APIs. No longer do Flow users need to explicitly type the return value of the `usePreloadedQuery`, `useQueryLoader`, `useRefetchableFragment`, `usePaginationFragment`, and `useBlockingPaginationFragment` API methods.

### Relay Resolver improvements

A significant portion of our development effort since our last release has gone into improving [Relay Resolvers](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/relay-resolvers) (a mechanism for exposing derived data in the graph). It is worth noting that Relay Resolvers are still experimental and API changes might occur in the future.

#### Terser docblock tags

The annotation for Relay Resolver functions has been simplified. In many scenarios you can now use the `ParentType.field_name: ReturnType` syntax to define what new field your Relay Resolver exposes. Note that this syntax can only be used if your Relay resolver returns an existing GraphQL type.

Before:

```js
/**
 * @RelayResolver
 * @onType User
 * @fieldName favorite_page
 * @rootFragment myRootFragment
 */
```

After:

```js
/**
 * @RelayResolver User.favorite_page: Page
 * @rootFragment myRootFragment
 */
```

#### Define multiple resolvers per file

Prior to this release we only allowed a single Relay Resolver per file and required the Relay Resolver function to be the default export. In Relay 15 you're now able to define multiple Relay Resolvers per file and use named exports.

```js
/**
 * @RelayResolver User.favorite_page: Page
 * @rootFragment favoritePageFragment
 */
function usersFavoritePage(){
  ...
}

/**
 * @RelayResolver User.best_friend: Friend
 * @rootFragment bestFriendFragment
 */
function usersBestFriend(){
  ...
}

module.exports = {
  usersFavoritePage,
  usersBestFriend
}
```

## What's new in the Relay VSCode Extension v2?

The latest version of the [Relay VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meta.relay) adds support for workspaces which contain multiple Relay configs in various subdirectories. Instead of only supporting a single Relay project at a time, you can now configure the `relay.projects` configuration to point to multiple Relay projects in a single workspace. This allows you to seamlessly switch between multiple projects and still be able to get field autocompletion, go to definition on fragments spreads, etc. And with the `relay.autoStartCompiler` you can have the Relay compiler run in watch mode on all projects in your workspace in parallel.

If you were previously using the `relay.rootDirectory` or `relay.pathToConfig` configuration options, those have been deprecated and you'll want to migrate those to the `relay.projects` configuration instead.

Before:

```json
// VSCode Settings
"relay.rootDirectory": "path/to/app",
"relay.pathToConfig": "config/relay.config.js"
```

After:

```json
// VSCode Settings
"relay.projects": [{
  "name": "my-app",
  "rootDirectory": "path/to/app",
  "pathToConfig": "config/relay.config.js"
}]
```

Note that your existing settings will continue to work in this release, but you should migrate to the new settings as they'll be removed in a future release.

Happy Querying!
