/**
 * A transform that removes redundant fields and fragment spreads. Redundancy is
 * defined in this context as any selection that is guaranteed to already be
 * fetched by an ancestor selection. This can occur in two cases:
 *
 * 1. Simple duplicates at the same level of the document can always be skipped:
 *
 * ```
 * fragment Foo on FooType {
 *   id
 *   id
 *   ...Bar
 *   ...Bar
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Becomes
 *
 * ```
 * fragment Foo on FooType {
 *   id
 *   ...Bar
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * 2. Inline fragments and conditions introduce the possibility for duplication
 * at different levels of the tree. Whenever a selection is fetched in a parent,
 * it is redundant to also fetch it in a child:
 *
 * ```
 * fragment Foo on FooType {
 *   id
 *   ... on OtherType {
 *     id # 1
 *   }
 *   ... on FooType @include(if: $cond) {
 *     id # 2
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Becomes:
 *
 * ```
 * fragment Foo on FooType {
 *   id
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In this example:
 * - 1 can be skipped because `id` is already fetched by the parent. Even
 *   though the type is different (FooType/OtherType), the inline fragment
 *   cannot match without the outer fragment matching so the outer `id` is
 *   guaranteed to already be fetched.
 * - 2 can be skipped for similar reasons: it doesn't matter if the condition
 *   holds, `id` is already fetched by the parent regardless.
 *
 * This transform also handles more complicated cases in which selections are
 * nested:
 *
 * ```
 * fragment Foo on FooType {
 *   a {
 *     bb
 *   }
 *   ... on OtherType {
 *     a {
 *       bb # 1
 *       cc
 *     }
 *   }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * Becomes
 *
 * ```
 * fragment Foo on FooType {
 *   a {
 *     bb
 *   }
 *   ... on OtherType {
 *     a {
 *       cc
 *     }
 *   }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * 1 can be skipped because it is already fetched at the outer level.

/**
 * The most straightforward approach would be two passes: one to record the
 * structure of the document, one to prune duplicates. This implementation uses
 * a single pass. Selections are sorted with fields first, "conditionals"
 * (inline fragments & conditions) last. This means that all fields that are
 * guaranteed to be fetched are encountered prior to any duplicates that may be
 * fetched within a conditional.
 *
 * Because selections fetched within a conditional are not guaranteed to be
 * fetched in the parent, a fork of the selection map is created when entering a
 * conditional. The sort ensures that guaranteed fields have already been seen
 * prior to the clone.
