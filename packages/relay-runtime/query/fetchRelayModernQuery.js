 * A helper function to fetch the results of a query. Note that results for
 * fragment spreads are masked: fields must be explicitly listed in the query in
 * order to be accessible in the result object.
 *
 * NOTE: This module is primarily intended for integrating with classic APIs.
 * Most product code should use a Renderer or Container.
 *
 * TODO(t16875667): The return type should be `Promise<?SelectorData>`, but
 * that's not really helpful as `SelectorData` is essentially just `mixed`. We
 * can probably leverage generated flow types here to return the real expected
 * shape.
