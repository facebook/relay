description: How to define fields for your client state schema using Relay Resolvers
---

Defining fields on a client type is as simple as defining a resolver function which accepts an instance of your model type as its first argument and returns the field value. Note that the exported function name must match the field name.

## Syntax

Relay resolvers are marked via docblocks above a resolver function. `@RelayResolver` is the tag to indicate the start of any relay resolver definition. To define a field on a GraphQL model type `TypeName`, add `TypeName` followed by a dot followed by the field definition using GraphQL's schema definition language: https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#FieldDefinition

```js
/**
* @RelayResolver TypeName.fieldName(arg1: ArgTypeName): FieldTypeName
*/
```

A simple field might look something like this:

```tsx
/**
 * @RelayResolver User.name: String
 */
export function name(user: UserModel): string {
  return user.name;
}
```

:::note
Relay will take care of efficiently recomputing resolvers when any of their inputs (in this case the model instance) change, so you donâ€™t need to worry about memoizing your resolver function.

This is just a simple resolver that reads from the model type and returns a scalar value. To learn about the full menu of capabilities that resolver fields support see:
