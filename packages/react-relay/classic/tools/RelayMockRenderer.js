/**
 * A helper for rendering RelayContainers with mock data, outside of a
 * RelayRootContainer/RelayRenderer. This is intended for use in unit tests or
 * component browser-style interfaces.
 *
 * Note: For unit tests, you may need to mock `ReactDOM` as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * jest
 *   .disableAutomock()
 *   .mock('ReactDOM', () => ({}));
 * ```
 *
 * Currently ReactDOM and ReactTestRenderer cannot both be loaded in the same
 * test, and Relay transitively includes ReactDOM under its default settings.
