# 2016 Recap & Status Update

It's been a while since our last meeting notes, thanks for your patience!

Over the last couple of months we've been focusing on building an experimental 
new core (that we've referred to as Relay "2") and integrating it into products 
internally. During this process we've refined the new apis, fixed bugs, added 
missing features, and worked to confirm our hypothesis that the more static core 
could bring performance improvements on mobile devices. The results so far are 
promising and we're continuing to pursue this direction.

We've also established a migration pathway for products currently using Relay. 
Over the next few months we'll be deprecating the current APIs (e.g. 
`RelayContainer`) and introducing a new product API: slimmed down evolutions of 
the `RelayRenderer`/`RelayRootContainer`, `RelayContainer`, `RelayMutation`, etc. 
Products can incrementally migrate to the new APIs, which are simpler and more 
predictable on their own. When fully converted, products can then toggle a 
switch to enable the experimental core, unlocking performance optimizations and 
  new features such as persisted queries. 

## Where's the code? When can I use this?

We're in the process of refining the new API, writing documentation, and adding 
examples. Stay tuned here for more information!
