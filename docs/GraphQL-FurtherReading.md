This concludes the overview of the GraphQL Relay Specifications. For the detailed requirements of a Relay-compliant GraphQL server, a more formal description of the [Relay cursor connection](/relay/graphql/connections.htm) model, the [Relay global object identification](/relay/graphql/objectidentification.htm) model, and the [Relay input object mutation](/relay/graphql/mutations.htm) are all available.

To see code implementing the specification, the [GraphQL.js Relay library](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js) provides helper functions for creating nodes, connections, and mutations; that repository's [`__tests__`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-relay-js/tree/master/src/__tests__) folder contains an implementation of the above example as integration tests for the repository.
