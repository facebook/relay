# Agenda

This was a quick sync for team members to share their status updates. The dominant themes continue to be rolling out the new Relay APIs at Facebook. Most of our work in recent months has been in the context of React Native, but recently we've been making preparations to roll out on web as well. Completing this internal rollout is a prerequisite to open sourcing the new implementation, so it is the team's top priority.
