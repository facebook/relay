(Relay only)

The hooks APIs that Relay exposes allow you to read data from the store only
during the render phase. In order to read data from outside of the render
phase (or from outside of React), Relay exposes the `@inline` directive. The
data from a fragment annotated with `@inline` can be read using `readInlineData`.

(Relay only)

A directive added to queries and fragments which causes the Relay client to throw
if reading a field that has an error. Relay will also honor the @semanticNonNull
direcitve on fields read from that query or fragment. Emitted types for such
fields will be non-null. Requires the `experimental_emit_semantic_nullability_types`
typegen configuration to be enabled.

types, or on a type that implements `Node` (i.e. a type that has an id).

**To resolve, replace `@dangerously_unaliased_fixme` with `@alias`**

This fragment spread will only conditionally be fetched, either due to
`@skip`/@include` or its type condition. Conditionally fetched fragments without
an `@alias` are unsafe because they don't expose any mechanism for the user to
check if the data was fetched before using the fragment. In these cases `@alias`
will materialize the fragment as a nullable named property, ensuring the proper
null checks are performed.

We now require all such fragment spreads to use `@alias`, and have marked
existing unsafe spreads with `@dangerously_unaliased_fixme`.
