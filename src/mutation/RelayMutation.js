   *
   * Fat queries can be written like normal GraphQL queries with one main
   * exception: fat queries use childless non-scalar fields to indicate that
   * anything under that field may change. For example, the fat query for
   * feedback_like contains the field `like_sentence` with no child fields.
   * This means that any field below `like_sentence` may change as a result of
   * feedback_like.

   * don't need to worry about overfetching here (this query is never executed

   * in the future when we add new views or modify existing ones.

   *      fieldIDs: {[fieldName: string]: DataID | Array<DataID>};

   *    where fieldIDs map `fieldName`s from the fatQuery to a DataID or
   *    array of DataIDs to be updated in the store.
   *
   * -  RANGE_ADD provides configuration for adding a new edge to a range.

   *    response that contains the newly created edge, `rangeBehaviors` maps
   *    stringified representation of calls on the connection to
   *    GraphQLMutatorConstants.RANGE_OPERATIONS.
   *
   * -  NODE_DELETE provides configuration for deleting a node and the
   *    corresponding edge from a range.
   *    {
   *      type: RelayMutationType.NODE_DELETE;
   *      parentName: string;
   *      parentID: string;
   *      connectionName: string;
   *      deletedIDFieldName: string;
   *    }
   *    where `parentName`, `parentID` and `connectionName` refer to the same
   *    things as in RANGE_ADD, `deletedIDFieldName` is the name of the key in
   *    the server response that contains the DataID of the deleted node.
   *
   * -  RANGE_DELETE provides configuration for deleting an edge from a range
   *    but doesn't delete the node.
   *    {
   *      type: RelayMutationType.RANGE_DELETE;
   *      parentName: string;

   *    `deletedIDFieldName` can also be a path from the response root to the
   *    deleted node. `pathToConnection` is a path from `parentName` to
   *    `connectionName`.
   *
   * -  REQUIRED_CHILDREN is used to append additional children (fragments or
   *    fields) to the mutation query. Any data fetched for these children is
   *    not written to the client store, but you can add code to process it
   *    in the `onSuccess` callback passed to the `RelayContext` `applyUpdate`
   *    method. You may need to use this, for example, to fetch fields on a new
   *    object created by the mutation (and which Relay would normally not
   *    attempt to fetch because it has not previously fetched anything for that
   *    object).
