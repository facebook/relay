# Updates

- [@JenniferWang](https://github.com/JenniferWang)

  - Updating an internal application to turn it into an educational sample project.
  - Working with Marketplace team on iterating the application under the new APIs.

- [@wincent](https://github.com/wincent)
  - Dealing with sync issues between repos.
- [@leebyron](https://github.com/leebyron)
  - Will set up experimental branch in Relay repo on GitHub so that we have a place to start sorting out the new code without interfering with master.
- [@kassens](https://github.com/kassens)
  - Cleaned up APIs (mutations no longer need to access context; making improvements to pagination container).
  - Documentation work.
  - Sped up our slowest compiler transform significantly by switching to an immutable data structure, making repeated clones much cheaper.
