  * Finished up benchmarks that were in flight.
  * Changed batch request stuff to be query-agnostic, so we can re-use it with the prototype.
  * Prototyping ideas for `RelayContainer`
  * Oncall stuff: eg. fixed conditional fragments for concrete types.
* [@sampepose](sampepose)
  * Jest:
    * Now there is a Jest runtime that we can use for scripts.
    * Will convert Relay stuff over to that.
  * Landed Flow type generation for mutation inputs.
  * Working on using new code for Flow types for fragments.

* [@JenniferWang](https://github.com/JenniferWang)
  * Started working on snapshot/screenshot test support.
* [@kassens](https://github.com/kassens)
  * Made persisted queries script more flexible so we can persist multiple app's queries at once.
  * Need to add gating and testing for next app and then we can go live with it.
  * Deleted old code for preload mode.
    * Our internal "Relay web" layer is basically just routing now.
